<p class="interests">I have had many interests over the years, but some have stuck with me much more than others. This include a variety of entertainments that I will go on to break down now.<br>
I would probably start with Pokemon, as not only has it been around since I was young, but I have also enjoyed the games my entire life. I have sunk thousands of hours into Pokemon games since I was a child, enjoying the strategic aspects and cool/cute Pokemon that give the games their life.<br>
My favourite Pokemon game that I played was easily HeartGold, or Platinum, however, I must shout out Sapphire as my first ever Pokemon game. If you'd like more info on some of my favourite Pokemon, click the link at the top of the page, or click <a href="pokemon.html">here.</a></p>

<p class="interests">However, this isn't the only franchise of games I hold dear, but is probably the most reknown. The franchise that I probably have spent the most time in is Destiny, although probably only just beating out Pokemon.<br>

There's something about being a gun toting, space wizard fighting hordes of enemies and gods is unbelievably satisfying. The way the game flows, the way things feel. Most importantly, it is easily one of the most beautiful games I have ever witnessed, with it's vast range of planets and locations to capture your attention.</p>

<p class="interests">My other main passtime is anime, which I have been an avid fan of for quite a few years now. I have watched thousands of episodes, including most of the big ones like One Piece, Naruto, Bleach and DBZ. However, I've watched plenty of different ones, ranging from many genres.<br>
To be able to narrow things down to find my favourite is a challenging ask, but one that stands out to mind is One Piece. From it's worldbuilding, to it's action, to it's comedy, this anime has it all. There's a reason it has over 1000 episodes.</p>
