    <p class="info">My name is James Pearson, and I'm a fairly chill guy. As I grew up, I was known as the smart kid who could do all the work.<br>
    However, I wasn't particularly popular, mostly because I wasn't interested in things that others liked, like football. <br>
    Instead, I had my own interests, which you can see<a href="interests.html">here</a>or by clicking the link at the top of the page.</p>
